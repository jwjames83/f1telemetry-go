# F1 Telemetry
This is a listener of Codemasters' F1 games, specifically F1 2020.
At the moment this library parses the 2020 UDP specification found [here](https://forums.codemasters.com/topic/50942-f1-2020-udp-specification/).
The idea of this project is to introduce gRPC to use the F1 UDP specification in various other projects, such as a custom
wheel, custom cockpit, or anything else your speedy heart desires. Basically, it's meant to make it slightly easier to use the
F1 UDP spec from Codemasters. 

Feel free to make a pull request or open a ticket.

# Goals
* Complete F1 2020 UDP implementation
* Complete F1 2019 UDP implementation
* Flutter display demo (as a seperate project yet to be started)

# License
At the moment, this project will be licensed under AGPL. However, as the project matures, it will move to something more
permissive such as MIT or Apache. With your help, we can all make this accessible to everyone for any purpose
sooner rather than later.
